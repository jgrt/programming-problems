Given two arrays: arr1[0..m-1] of size m and arr2[0..n-1] of size n.
Task is to check whether arr2[] is a subset of arr1[] or not.
Both the arrays can be both unsorted or sorted. It may be assumed that elements in both array are distinct.
Return 1 if arr2 is subset of arr1 else 0.

Constraints:
1 <= m,n <= 10^5
1 <= arr1[i], arr2[j] <= 10^5

Input: arr1 = 11 1 13 21 3 7
       arr2 = 11 3 7 1
Output: 1
