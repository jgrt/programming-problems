You are given an array A[] of size N.
Now, we call the value of an array the bit-wise XOR of all elements it contains.
For example, the value of the array [1,2,3] = 1^2^3.
Now, Your task is to find the bit-wise XOR of the values of all sub arrays of array A.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= A[] <= 10000

Input: arr = 1 2 3
Output: 2
